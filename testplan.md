## 1. Introduction
###  1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test 
effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software, and is the top-level plan generated 
and used by managers to direct the test effort.

This Test plan for Project MovieTunes supports the following objectives:
- Identifying the items that should be targeted by the tests.
- Identifying the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
- Outlining the testing approach that will be used.
- Identifying the required resources and providing an estimation for the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

Project MovieTunes tested using unit tests and function tests as testing methods to ensure that the implementation is working 
correctly throughout the development.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is written mainly for internal usage by the project team and contains technically detailed informations
about testing the application.
The basic description of the application itself is not part of it. Therefore this document is for the developers and 
for readers with the necessary background knowledge. However, everyone interested is invited to read this document.

### 1.6 Document Structure
See [Table of Contents](#-table-of-contents)

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

The test coverage for our project leads to a better control of new implementations and the changes made to existing code.
It gives us a better possibility to make sure that future changes won't influence the functionality in a negative way. The 
integration of testing into the deployment process ensures that just stable versions which meet our quality requirements 
are being deployed.

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission
 
The main reason for implementing tests is to ensure that occurring problems are identified as early as possible. This
leads to stable and working versions of our project. Continuous testing provides us the opportunity to automatically 
verify the functionality of our project. With Test Driven Development (TDD) the tests are written before 
the functionality itself gets implemented. This helps to prevent problems before they occur.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

The motivation to use testing in our project was to reduce functional risks and keep the quality as high as possible. 
It helps to fulfill the needed requirements and is good for implementing the Use Cases by checking the correct working 
results.

## 3. Target Test Items

The following list identifies the tested parts of our application. Tests will cover the logical implementations.

- Frontend (Java/Android)
- Business logic (Java)  
- Database operations (Java) 

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests


### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

- Logical functionality will be tested with unit tests and function tests.
- Database Integrity will be tested with function tests.


### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion
There are possible additional options for testing but these are not in scope of our testing yet.

- testing the user interface
- testing the performance of the application
- stress testing the server

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

n/a

## 5. Test Approach
### 5.1 Initial Test-Idea Catalogs and Other Reference Sources
The concept of unit testing is to structure the code into pieces that are as small as possible. These units ar going to 
be tested individually to check the functionality on the lowest possible level. Due to this partitioning of the 
implementation, bugs and problems can be found rather easily. If the granular functionalities have been approved, 
the units can be put together to modules, which then will be tested on this higher level. Unit Testing has proven to 
be a good way to find bugs and problems in software early and reliable.

### 5.2 Testing Techniques and Types

#### 5.2.1 Data and Database Integrity Testing

| Success Criteria: | All tests pass and the required code coverage is given. TravisCI build passes and all tests run green |
| Special Considerations: | -|

#### 5.2.3 Business Cycle Testing
n/a

#### 5.2.4 User Interface Testing
|| |
|---|---|
|Technique Objective  	| Exercise the most scenarios to observe and log standards conformance and target behavior |
|Technique |  Execute each use-case scenarioâ€™s individual use-case flows or functions and features, using valid and invalid data |
|Oracles |  user enter valid data, for example a valid username and a valid password   |
|Required Tools | Selenium, Espresso, Cucumber	 |
|Success Criteria |    All tests pass         |
|Special Considerations	|     -          |

## 6. Entry and Exit Criteria
### 6.1Test Plan
#### 6.1.1 Test Plan Entry Criteria
The execution of the test plan can begin as soon as the first unit test is written and a new version of the 
application was committed to GitHub and built.

#### 6.1.2 Test Plan Exit Criteria
The execution of the Test Plan is completed when all test run without errors and the project is finished.

#### 6.1.3 Suspension and Resumption Criteria
The test plan is not supposed to be suspended. Therefore, there are no suspension and resumption criteria.  

### 6.2 Test Cycles

#### 6.2.1 Test Cycle Entry Criteria
A test cycle begins when the build of a new version is initiated.

#### 6.2.2 Test Cycle Exit Criteria
The test effort of a cycle is deemed sufficient when a build has been completed without failures and all unit tests are run successfully.

#### 6.2.3 Test Cycle Abnormal Termination
Occurring errors during the build terminate the test cycle.

## 8.Testing Workflow
When an developer adds new functionality to the project, he also writes an appropriate Unit-Test covering the functionality. 
All unit tests and function tests are then automatically executed on a build.
The developer can also test parts of the new code by running the tests from his IDE.

## 9. Environmental Needs
